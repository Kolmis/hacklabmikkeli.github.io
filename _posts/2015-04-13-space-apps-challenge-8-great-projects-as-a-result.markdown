First prize went to [SpaceShield](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/spaceshield/) team. Four students from Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences successfully solved the [Neuromorphic Studies of Asteroid Imagery](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/neuromorphic-studies-asteroid-imagery/). Lots of excellent work which also received enthusiastic feedback from NASA. You should take a look at their comprehensive [report](https://spaceshield.hackpad.com/SpaceShield-MW4Tamjypzr#:h=Results).

We as Hacklab Mikkeli wanted to award two teams - insteaf of just one as planned - due to extreme dedication on hacking shown by both two teams. *Hacking > sleep*. Also keeping up the morale in the hackathon was considered a nice bonus. Both teams did meet their goals and break their technical skill limits. Some might say this was a learning experience. The awarded teams were [2 Guys 1 ISS](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/isstagram/) and [Challenge? Accepted!](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/fast-aid-kit/).

This was ~~maybe~~ the biggest hackathon ever in Mikkeli. Wonderful people. Wonderful weekend. Wonderful hacking. Wonderful sponsors. Wonderful organizing teams. Hacklab Mikkeli will be definitely arranging more events like this.
